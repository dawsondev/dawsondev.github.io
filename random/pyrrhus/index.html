<p>In this post I want to make the case why I think my bro <strong>Pyrrhus of Epirus</strong> is one of the most underrated military generals in history.</p>
<h5 id="the-overrated-ones">The overrated ones</h5>
<p>Everybody knows Alexander the Great. But this guy inherited a large, very professional, veteran and battle hardened Army from his daddy. <em>Lame</em>. Yes he went on to conquer the known (to greece) world but still.</p>
<p>Everybody knows Napoleon Bonaparte but this guy did the old mistake of venturing into russia without packing some winter clothes. <em>Rookie mistake</em>.</p>
<p>Everybody knows Julius Caesar but this guy was literally shanked by a bunch of dudes wearing sauna towels. <em>Pff</em>.</p>
<p>Enter the man the myth the unfortunately not well known legend, Pyrrhus.
You may have heard of his name in the term <em>pyrrhic victory</em>. It means you achieve your goals but at the cost of almost losing everything. But IMO history did this guy dirty.</p>
<p>First off Pyrrhus pulled himself up by his boostraps, unlike Alexander the nepo baby. He inherited a pretty crap army that was still using (in this period) heavily outdated sarissa pikes and yes, elephants. The guy used elephants. Before it was cool. He lived in stretch of land known as Apollonia (nowadays Albania and some parts of northern Greece). Via his mom he had geneological ties to Alexander the Great&rsquo;s line but he was out to make his own name.</p>
<h4 id="bullying-the-romans">Bullying the romans.</h4>
<p>And boy was Pyrrhus ambitious. At this time, &ldquo;Rome&rdquo; was little more than an italian regional power growing in central italy. So Pyrrhus thought he might as well sail over there, put a smackdown on them and conquer their lands and bobs your uncle. So thats what he set out to do.</p>
<p>Pyrrhus started of strong, securing a string of victories albeit losing like his entire army every time. But Pyrrhus didn&rsquo;t let those details dissuade him from his goals. It wasn&rsquo;t his fault anyway, his bumbling commanders kept messing up orders and reportedely got drunk the night before certain key battles. Should have had a better compliance deparment, Pyrrhus.</p>
<p>Again, keep in mind that Pyrrhus was basically doing the equivalent of using bolt action rifles against enemies with assault rifles. His military doctrine which was basically still that of Alexander the Great&rsquo;s <em>pointy sticks and (horses) elephants go brr</em> was outmatched in technology by the romans, who used primarily heavily armed infantry with excellent equipment and training.</p>
