      <p>Hi I am Oli, 27 years old and currently a Student of &ldquo;Wirtschaftsinformatik&rdquo; at Karlsruhe University. Literally translated this means Economics Computer Science but is also known as Business Information Systems. Glad you are taking the time to take a look at my little slice of the web. For Details on my professional journey until now, you can look at my CV found under the respective menu item.</p>
<p>Professionally I aim for a career in Cybersecurity and one reason for this website is to document my journey to become adept in this field, and include some write-ups for CTF challenges like those on <a href="https://tryhackme.com/">https://tryhackme.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Other than that I am interested in Data Science/Machine Learning, Company/Stock Analysis, and other closely-related IT/Business topics.</p>
<p>Further, I am passionate about history (but I am only an armchair historian and do not claim any professional expertise) and also enjoy Scuba-diving and guitar. Like most of my generation I also like playing the odd video game if time allows.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-website">About this Website</h2>
<p>This website is an ongoing personal project.
I created it using hugo and the m10c theme. The website is hosted on github pages and thus static. Check out my github for details on my code structure, but basically I made one production repo and one submodule repo I deploy to via the public folder which is where hugo makes the actual website build, so I can organize my code better.</p>
<p>I want to credit my friend Jesse Yu-Chieh Kuo from my taiwan exchange semester and his website (check it out at <a href="https://ujkuo.github.io/">https://ujkuo.github.io/</a>) for inspiration.</p>
<p>Also check out my Aunt Inés&rsquo; website at <a href="https://www.inesdawson.com/">https://www.inesdawson.com/</a>. She makes cool educational content related to many fields in science and holds a PhD in Biology from Oxford University.</p>
