      <description>Hi I am Oli, 28 years old and a graduate of &amp;ldquo;Wirtschaftsinformatik&amp;rdquo; (M.Sc.) at Karlsruhe University. Literally translated this means Economics Computer Science but is also known as Business Information Systems. Glad you are taking the time to take a look at my little slice of the web. For Details on my professional journey until now, you can look at my CV found under the respective menu item.&#xA;Professionally I aim for a career in Cybersecurity and one reason for this website is to document my journey to become adept in this field, and include some write-ups for guides (mainly for my own reference, so I do not have to use my hundreds of bookmarks&amp;hellip;) and eventually CTF challenges like those on https://tryhackme.</description>

      <description>How to get started with all things Data Science? In this post I wanted to share what resources helped me most on the journey to learn the most important concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning. While I am no means an expert and this field is unbelievably large, I managed to learn a lot about these topics through my course at university and in my free time and just wanted to make a guided list of the various knowledge sources I found most helpful as a beginner.</description>

      <description>Advanced Digital Forensics Guide (Disk Imaging to File Carving) Digital forensic investigations require a methodical approach and expertise in various tools and techniques. This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step walkthrough of advanced disk forensics – from acquiring a forensically sound image of a “cold” (powered-off) system, through detailed file system analysis (FAT32 and ext3/ext4), to recovering deleted data via file carving. All procedures emphasize open-source tools on Linux. Use this as a detailed checklist and reference for conducting thorough forensic analysis.</description>

      <description>Using Feature Engineering and Machine Learning to predict tipping behaviour in customers This was our Semester Project in the Master&amp;rsquo;s Course Data Science. It was an interesting and challenging project which brought together all relevant base concepts of Data Science including tuning our data to offer more useful features and training a machine learning model (in our case an xgboosted decision tree) to try and predict if a given order will lead to a tip or not.</description>
